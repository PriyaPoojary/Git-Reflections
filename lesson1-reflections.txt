How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
--By Comparing the two versions of a file, I have been able to find the bug  introduces by changes made in the new version.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
--It will help me when I make changes and help me understand why and how I made those changes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
--Pros are: It helps me to decide which changes goes in one commit ratther than randomly commiting changes automatically.
Cons: I have to manually commit everytime I make changes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
--It is because version control systems like Git has some advantage over google docs

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
--Git log shows you the changges been committed in a file starting from the most recent commit, git diff allows you o compare any two commit and track teh changes introduced by the latest commit.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
--Because I can revert to a previous commit any time I want.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
--I would use git version control to try out new changes on my code while doing front end development.
